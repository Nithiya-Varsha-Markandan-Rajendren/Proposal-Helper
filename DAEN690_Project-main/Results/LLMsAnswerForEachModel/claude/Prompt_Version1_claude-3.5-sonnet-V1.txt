    "question": "How does the Railcar Switch Module trigger notifications to users, and which component handles these notifications?",
    "answer": "LLM Answer:\n\nConfidence score: 4\n\nAnswer: The Railcar Switch Module uses Power Automate to trigger notifications to users when the railcar status changes to Arrival or Release. The component responsible for handling these notifications is the Power Automate flow named \"Railcar Send Notifications\".\n\nBased on the reference content, the Railcar Switch Module is developed using SharePoint, PowerApps, and Power Automate. The application design section specifically mentions that **Power Automate is used \"To send the notifications to the users when the Railcar Status changes to Arrival and Release.\"** This indicates that Power Automate is the component responsible for handling the notifications.\n\nThe flow chart in the reference material shows that the Switch Crew User updates the railcar status to \"Arrival or Departure and Move\". When this status change occurs, it likely triggers the Power Automate flow. Additionally, the flow chart shows the Data Control Center updating the railcar status to \"Release\", which would also trigger notifications through the Power Automate flow.\n\nIt's worth noting that the specific details of how the Power Automate flow is configured are not provided in the reference material. However, given the name of the flow (**\"Railcar Send Notifications\"**) and its stated purpose, it's clear that this is the component responsible for handling and sending out the notifications to users based on the railcar status changes.\n\n"
